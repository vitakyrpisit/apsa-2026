"""Rebadge gate for cycle 2791: validate_cycle2790.py -> validate_cycle2791.py.

The REBADGE-CLASS continues (the v90 source survived on disk and in the
e4a79df commit object — object-verified at guard time). Every patch asserts
its old string occurs EXACTLY once in the source BEFORE any mutation;
abort = zero files written. Post-patch: selective no-old-token assertions +
py_compile. Patch count is counted programmatically.
DRIFT-#49 pass-40 spec (per the c2790 Next-block): baseline = the pass-1
observation (18,0,0,18,0) @ 446B (opened at c2752 — the first market movement
since LOSS-#83; pass-2 repeat recorded at c2753; ... pass-38 repeat recorded
at c2789; pass-39 repeat recorded at c2790); a repeat -> pass-40 recorded
(movement repeat-class, the DRIFT-#48 root (20,0,2,18,0) remains LOCKED, never
rewritten); a return to (20,0,2,18,0) -> the RESTORATION event recorded (the
root stands, the pass-1 excursion closes as a transient); any other
composition -> newest-observation evidence with the full delta chain printed.
The lag-1 pattern spans BOTH instrument surfaces (the c2772..c2790
attempt-1 clean runs + the c2770 attempt-1 P3 abort lesson + the c2761
attempt-1 P8 lesson): the v90 source carries 'pass-38 band' AND 'pass-38
evidence' — this rebadge's P3/P8 old-strings expect the lag, not the class
name.
Hash-artifact watch (the c3819e9 + c7947 lessons — checked BEFORE patching):
the official c2790 commit hash e4a79df short form = e-4-a-7-9-d-f — it
carries NO 'c' character at all, so NO c+4-digit run is present and the
hash-artifact class does NOT fire this cycle; the v91 P2 paragraph carries
'the e4a79df commit object' (zero new hash-artifact birth), while the v90 P2
carry 'the 2af9fd7 commit object' rebadges AWAY (2af9fd7 also carries no
'c', so zero token deaths — the c7947 class does NOT fire); the foreign TOP
3b69581 short form = 3-b-6-9-5-8-1 — it carries NO 'c' character either
(zero c+4-digit run, zero exposure); the c2791 commit hash is unborn at
patch time, checked post-commit.
